# Python-Mysql-Banking-Project
Bank management project. This includes creating a account and use it for crediting and debiting. The card stores the information of their name, class &amp; section account number, password, amount in their id .Each card are embedded with student’s id and password . Check the attached word file for more details
Even if the cards are lost we can retrieve it with their admission number also with the money in card.
All the transaction records of amount debited and the money spent will be stored for parent’s notice.
As it is not safe for students to carry money parents can pay in the office for the card ,the amount  will credited in the card .
If a student needs to cancel the canteen card we will return the money debited in it (if there is balance in their account).
